This one was fun! If you're a programmer watching a Youtube video or see a photo of some code you want, don't try to copy/paste!!!
- Simply screenshot/save the photo
- Enter it into this program and it will create a .py OR .js file with all the unformatted text. 
- Feel free to rename the file and take it elsewhere.
