This one was fun! If you're a programmer watching a Youtube video or see a photo of some code you want, don't try to copy/paste!!!
- Simply screenshot/save the photo of code...
- Enter it into this program (command-line: python3 scraper.py) and it will create a .py OR .js file with all the unformatted text. 
- Feel free to rename the file and take it elsewhere.

- again, run (python3 scraper.py) in your CL to run program.
